# Real-Time-Face-mask-detection

Real-Time Face Mask Detection is a Python project that detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time using machine learning techniques. The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a dataset of images containing people with and without face masks.

## Features

- Real-time detection of face masks using a webcam or camera.
- High accuracy in classifying face masks 95% .

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AyatOthman/Real-Time-Face-mask-detection.git


Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Real-Time Face Mask Detection

Real-Time Face Mask Detection is a Python project that detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time using machine learning techniques. The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a dataset of images containing people with and without face masks.

## Features

- Real-time detection of face masks using a webcam or camera.
- High accuracy in classifying face masks.
- Easy-to-use interface with minimal setup required.
- Open-source and customizable for specific use cases.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/real-time-face-mask-detection.git
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:
python detect_face_mask.py

## Usage
Launch the application using the command provided in the installation steps.
Position yourself in front of the camera.
The application will detect whether you are wearing a face mask or not in real-time.
You will see the results displayed on the screen.
Dataset
The dataset used to train the face mask detection model is the [Face Mask 12K Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset).

##Model
The machine learning model used for face mask detection is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using the TensorFlow framework.
